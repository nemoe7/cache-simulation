# Test Case A

For our cache type, the test case has a 100% cache miss.

If the Set Size >= 2n cache blocks, the 1st loop over the cache blocks will always be a miss, but the next 3 loops will always be cache hits. Otherwise, there is a 100% miss rate if the Set Size < 2n cache blocks. The reason for this is that if the Set Size is larger than or equal to 2n cache blocks, there is enough space to load all sequential memory blocks into the cache, so the following loops after the first loop will always be cache hits. If the Set Size is smaller, there won't be enough space for all memory blocks, so the remaining memory blocks transferred in the first loop will replace the positions of the memory blocks that were placed first (FIFO), which continues throughout the loop, resulting in a 100% cache miss.

# Test Case B

Given the random sequence, the average memory access time across 3 runs seems to be around 300 ns. The total access time also ranges from 18 to 19 thousand ns.
This is expected as this is a randomly generated sequence where the possibility of a cache hit will be low if memory size is high.

# Test Case C

Because of this test case's specifications requiring 2n cache blocks with a constant cache size of 16 blocks, memory size should be set to 32 or higher.
[16] cache blocks, [32] words per cache block, [4] blocks per set, [32] main memory blocks

Starting at block 0, the first iteration of the sequence up until the n-1(14) cache block are cache misses, amounting up to n-1*(32*10+1)ns or 4815ns memory access time.
*n is the number of cache blocks

When the sequence repeats cache block 1 to the n-1(14) cache block, they are all cache hits (cache remains unchanged) as all memory blocks of the first iteration were still inside cache, amounting up to (n-1-1)*(32)ns or 448ns memory access time. [block 0 is not included in the second iteration]

Memory sequence then increments until the 2n cache block, which are also cache misses, amounting up to n+1*(32*10+1)ns or 5457ns memory access time.

The entire sequence is then repeated 4 times, wherein cache from the previous sequence iteration does not cause any cache hits, resulting in a final memory access time of 4*(4815+448+5457)ns or 42880ns. Each sequence iteration has 14 cache hits and 32 cache misses.
